A queue is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. You can describe it as a **first in, first out** (FIFO) structure; the first element to be added to the queue will be the first element to be removed from the queue. New elements are added to the back or rear of the queue. When an element is removed, the remaining elements do not move up to take the empty space. To keep the order of the queue you need to maintain a **pointer** to the **front**, which indicates the element at the front of the queue, and one to the **rear**, which indicates the element at the back of the queue.
